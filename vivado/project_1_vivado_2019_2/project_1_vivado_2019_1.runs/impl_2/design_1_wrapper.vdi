This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1840] RAMB18 async control check: The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/FIR_3/inst/FIR_RAM_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/filtre/RAMAudio/mem_reg has an input control pin design_1_i/FIR_3/inst/FIR_RAM_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/filtre/RAMAudio/mem_reg/ADDRBWRADDR[9] (net: design_1_i/FIR_3/inst/FIR_RAM_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/filtre/RAMAudio/mem_reg_0[4]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/FIR_3/inst/FIR_RAM_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/filtre/waddrRAM_reg[4]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
