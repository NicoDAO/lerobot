# lerobot

#project to run a robot with ultrasound sensor and 2 DC electrical motors.
#Project is running on Zybo card from digilent, with Pmod extensions.
#The core of the system is a Zynq 7000 from xilinx.
#I use Yocto to generate the linux minimal core, with gcc, gdb and ssh.
#The bitstream of the FPGA part is used to drive the 2 DC motor and the ultrasound sensor.
